# Wardrobe Manager

Android application to manage the user's wardrobe with outfit creation from user inputted clothing items.

## Project Description
User enters the Android application to the closet full of all the user's available clothing items. The user can select an item and change the properties of that item including color(s), brand, size, material, laundry status and more. From the closet activity the user is also able to access the main menu where the user can add a clothing item, sort the clothing items, and search for a clothing item. From the menu the user is also able to access the outfit creation activity where the app generates an outfit from the clothing items in the user's closet following fashion constraints. The project has not been fully completed as the project ended with the end of the schoolyear.
